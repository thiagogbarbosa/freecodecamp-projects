/* Palindrome Checker. palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read
the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case and spacing

You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols)
and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case)
in order to check for palindromes.
